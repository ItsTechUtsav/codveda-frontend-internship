# Advanced Animations (Level 3)

This project was completed as part of the Level 3 tasks during my frontend internship.  
The purpose of this task was to explore how animations can be used in a meaningful way without affecting performance or usability.

In this project, I created a simple UI and enhanced it with smooth animations using GSAP.  
The animations are triggered by user actions such as page load, hover, and scroll, and are kept subtle to avoid distracting the user.  
Timeline-based animations were used to manage sequences in a clean and controlled way.

Through this task, I learned how to balance visual appeal with performance and accessibility, and how thoughtful animations can improve the overall user experience when used correctly.
