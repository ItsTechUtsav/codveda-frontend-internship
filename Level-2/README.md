# REST API Integration (Level 2)

This project was completed as part of the Level 2 tasks during my frontend internship.  
The objective of this task was to work with a public REST API and display data dynamically based on user input.

In this project, a GitHub user search feature was implemented where users can search for a GitHub profile by username.  
The application fetches data from the GitHub public API and updates the UI in real time.  
Loading and error states were handled to keep the interaction smooth and user-friendly.

This task helped me understand how APIs work in real-world applications and improved my confidence in handling asynchronous data using JavaScript.
