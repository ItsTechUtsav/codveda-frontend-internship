# Interactive Form (Level 1)

This project is part of the Level 1 tasks completed during my frontend internship.  
The goal of this task was to build a clean and interactive form using core web technologies.

The form includes basic user inputs such as name, email, phone number, and password.  
It provides real-time feedback to users and displays clear error messages when the input is not valid.  
Simple UI and smooth interactions were prioritized to ensure a good user experience.

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript-based user interactions.
